# My Reflective Portfolio 


##Week 1

### What did I learn this week? 

In my first week of this class, I developed a new understanding of the concept of systems. Suck as the ideas of a "Complex" and "Complicated" system. 
A complex system being described as a "bugworld" being loosely connected with unpredictable independant parts working together either directly or indirectly to create a complex and adaptive system. 
Examples of this are weather systems, society and traffic jams. 


I then learnt that complicated world was rigid, predictable and unable to adapt to changes. This was described as a cogworld, which made it easy to rationalise and make sense of in my head. 
AN example of this is the components of a watch. 

However I am still confused, as some complex systems could also be perceived as complicated. This can be seen with the use of the pool table analogy.
Someone in the chat described as "a complex system in our world are normally adaptive as most systems in our world are. However if you would consider the entire world to follow the pool table anology where each event is a product of the previous event then like a system of cogs the entire fate of the world is predetermined and thus a complicated system"
So this conflicts in my mind and it will be something I will continue to ponder throughout the this class. 

One thing I did find diffulcult was how abstract these concepts are which are quite easy to simplify but are quite sophiscated to think about on the level we are doing in class
#Week 2 

## What did I learn this week? 

This second week I learn't about the concept of model thinking. Which was also an entirely new concept in my mind, due to the sense that I had never thought of my thinking in this way. 

However after more thinking about this idea of model thiniings, it makes more sense. Its pretty much thinking of a basic concept in the complex way.

##Week 3 

The class this week made more sense to me. While the idea of modelling how people think/act at first seemed like a hard task and something that I would think would be almost impossible.
Ended up completely making sense after the workship.

The Ideas of: 

Rational Modelling - based in the assumption that people always behave in most optimal way to achieve their goals. e.g economic models.
Thoughts - While i definitely think this model would be very useful on a macrolevel as everyone wants to do the best for themsleves. I think modelling more on a smaller and individual scale
it would be ineffective as it doesnt account for personal bias etc. 

Behavourial Modelling - Accounts for all aspects of human nature i.e bias
I think this is the most useful and effective way of modelling as it accounts for human nature. However I feel as though this would be ineffecient and unnecessarily complex model on large scales.
due to that fact if you where modelling a scenario with <1,000 people it would take large amounts of time and effort in order to accurately model all of their bias'

Rule based modelling - I find this the hardest to be accurate and useful, unless fair amounts of signal modelling have been done, as too give further insights on to things such a descision trees. 

I found this concept of signal modelling really intresesting. As people usually use signals to draw infomation from reactions, however I never conceptualised it as rigid model. 
Learning about this has also helped with my understanding of the business part of my degree. Signal modelling definitely would be used when companys are thinking about marketing, branding and advertising. 

Week 6: 
While this week for me was a bit harder then other weeks as I missed quite a bit of work from week 4 and week 5, it was still intresesting and still expanded my knowledge despite my lack of prior knowledge from the earlier weeks. 
We went through Markov Models. Which I think is named after the guy who created these models: Andrey Markov. 

The two i took most out of where Path Dependance and the Urn Model. 

Path Dependance is the idea that what happens in a moment is determined by the events preceeding it. So the probability of an outcome can theoritcally be determined on what happened before it. 
Examples of this could be: 
AC vs DC electricity 
Gas vs Electric Cars
Common Law, where on depending on what decisions are made, earlier play a role in how future cases are determined. 
The Urn Model is a system of modelling used which simulates this idea of path dependance. 

Week 7: 
This week I found the lesson easier to follow on with, as I tried to stay focused the entire time. I am still trying to wrap my head around the conceptual idea of models and systems as this idea that we can model and systemise everything is quite abstract and fairly new to my mind. 
We went through the idea of Peer Effects, Social Contaigion and Culture/Coordination. 

Social Contaigion - People conforming to social norms. 
I understood this idea by thinking of examples e.g Social pressure to wear masks in COVID-19, Panicking buying, fashion trends, the rise and fall of smoking ciggarettes. 

We then went through models, which can simulate this idea of social contaigion, which I thought is interesting. As I thought something as intricate and abstract as human trends and social interection would be hard to codify into something like a mathematical model.

The models we went through where: 

The Schelling Segregation Model: They way I understood this was that microbehaviours create their own outcomes which ultimately lead to one main outcome. However this main outcome isn't due to one factor inparticular. 
It also went by the idea that People have a threshold of wanting to have people of a similiar type around them before they move. 
I am not sure if my understanding of this model is correct however. 

Granovetters Model: 
This model effectively models how riots start. 
It goes by the concept that people will have a certain number in their head of how many are acting out on behaviour before they join in, thus its good for simulating riots. 
However, if the people around it have a high enough threshold before they commit a certain action or behaviour no effect will occur.
