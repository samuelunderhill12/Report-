# My Reflective Portfolio 


##Week 1

### What did I learn this week? 

In my first week of this class, I developed a new understanding of the concept of systems. Suck as the ideas of a "Complex" and "Complicated" system. 
A complex system being described as a "bugworld" being loosely connected with unpredictable independant parts working together either directly or indirectly to create a complex and adaptive system. 
Examples of this are weather systems, society and traffic jams. 


I then learnt that complicated world was rigid, predictable and unable to adapt to changes. This was described as a cogworld, which made it easy to rationalise and make sense of in my head. 
AN example of this is the components of a watch. 

However I am still confused, as some complex systems could also be perceived as complicated. This can be seen with the use of the pool table analogy.
Someone in the chat described as "a complex system in our world are normally adaptive as most systems in our world are. However if you would consider the entire world to follow the pool table anology where each event is a product of the previous event then like a system of cogs the entire fate of the world is predetermined and thus a complicated system"
So this conflicts in my mind and it will be something I will continue to ponder throughout the this class. 

One thing I did find diffulcult was how abstract these concepts are which are quite easy to simplify but are quite sophiscated to think about on the level we are doing in class
#Week 2 

## What did I learn this week? 

This second week I learn't about the concept of model thinking. Which was also an entirely new concept in my mind, due to the sense that I had never thought of my thinking in this way. 

However after more thinking about this idea of model thiniings, it makes more sense. Its pretty much thinking of a basic concept in the complex way.

##Week 3 

The class this week made more sense to me. While the idea of modelling how people think/act at first seemed like a hard task and something that I would think would be almost impossible.
Ended up completely making sense after the workship.

The Ideas of: 

Rational Modelling - based in the assumption that people always behave in most optimal way to achieve their goals. e.g economic models.
Thoughts - While i definitely think this model would be very useful on a macrolevel as everyone wants to do the best for themsleves. I think modelling more on a smaller and individual scale
it would be ineffective as it doesnt account for personal bias etc. 

Behavourial Modelling - Accounts for all aspects of human nature i.e bias
I think this is the most useful and effective way of modelling as it accounts for human nature. However I feel as though this would be ineffecient and unnecessarily complex model on large scales.
due to that fact if you where modelling a scenario with <1,000 people it would take large amounts of time and effort in order to accurately model all of their bias'

Rule based modelling - I find this the hardest to be accurate and useful, unless fair amounts of signal modelling have been done, as too give further insights on to things such a descision trees. 

I found this concept of signal modelling really intresesting. As people usually use signals to draw infomation from reactions, however I never conceptualised it as rigid model. 
Learning about this has also helped with my understanding of the business part of my degree. Signal modelling definitely would be used when companys are thinking about marketing, branding and advertising.
