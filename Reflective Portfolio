# My Reflective Portfolio 


##Week 1

### What did I learn this week? 

In my first week of this class, I developed a new understanding of the concept of systems. Suck as the ideas of a "Complex" and "Complicated" system. 
A complex system being described as a "bugworld" being loosely connected with unpredictable independant parts working together either directly or indirectly to create a complex and adaptive system. 
Examples of this are weather systems, society and traffic jams. 


I then learnt that complicated world was rigid, predictable and unable to adapt to changes. This was described as a cogworld, which made it easy to rationalise and make sense of in my head. 
AN example of this is the components of a watch. 

However I am still confused, as some complex systems could also be perceived as complicated. This can be seen with the use of the pool table analogy.
Someone in the chat described as "a complex system in our world are normally adaptive as most systems in our world are. However if you would consider the entire world to follow the pool table anology where each event is a product of the previous event then like a system of cogs the entire fate of the world is predetermined and thus a complicated system"
So this conflicts in my mind and it will be something I will continue to ponder throughout the this class. 

One thing I did find diffulcult was how abstract these concepts are which are quite easy to simplify but are quite sophiscated to think about on the level we are doing in class
#Week 2 

## What did I learn this week? 

This second week I learn't about the concept of model thinking. Which was also an entirely new concept in my mind, due to the sense that I had never thought of my thinking in this way.
